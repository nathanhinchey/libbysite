       Libby was truly a great find as a math tutor for our 8th grade daughter. After screening at least a dozen tutors and interviewing a handful of them, Libby proved to have the best combination of math experience (we needed her strong foundation in algebra and geometry) and more generally tutoring experience (broad not only in terms of years but also the many subjects she is qualified to tutor). Our daughter added that Libby's teaching style combines innovative learning techniques with an enjoyment of both the subject matter and her students. As a result, our daughter scored higher than expected on the math sections of her ISEE, and received a full letter grade higher than expected in her 8th math class. Perhaps most importantly, Libby made a difference in our daughter's confidence level and enjoyment of math. Finally, beyond her tutoring, we were so appreciative of the fact that Libby is punctual and very reasonably priced. So our only reservation in writing this review is that we hope Libby will again be available when our daughter starts high school in the fall! Thank you Libby.

       Libby is very patient, and my children (middle schoolers) always look forward to working with her. She has great ideas for teaching concepts more than one way. She is reliable and punctual. We highly recommend her.

       Libby has tutored my 6th grade daughter in math this last semester. We found Libby to be an excellent tutor. She is very patient and friendly, and my daughter really likes her. Libby has an excellent knowledge of the math material and has carefully thought through the best ways to present it. She uses manipulatives, games and visual techniques very effectively. She has been very reliable and conscientious. I would highly recommend her.

       My daughter is in 10th grade and was having trouble with geometry and was really stressed about her grade. Libby is able to explain the math problems so that my daughter not only understands that problem but the whole concept. Her test scores have improved, which means her grade has improved, which means no more stress!

       I am very lucky to have found Libby as my writing tutor; if it was not because of her I donï¿½t know how it would have been possible for me to finish my semester. She was very helpful in explaining all the mechanics of writing in a very clear and concise way. Her style, knowledge about the English language and her thinking abilities were so incredibly beneficial in my learning. She helped me breakdown my homework in a way that with was easy to understand what was required from my teacher. Her personality, knowledge and approaches in tutoring are superb! I highly recommend Libby as the person that would help you in your academic life. She is an amazing gifted tutor!

       Libby has a wonderful rapport with my son, who she tutors in spanish. He is always excited to see her, and eager to see what new book she has brought with her to the session. Her intelligence, patience and warmth, plus her ability to really "see" my son and find out what motivates him, make her an excellent tutor. I highly recommend her!
